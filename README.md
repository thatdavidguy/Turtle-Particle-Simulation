## Turtle Dance Off 🐢💃

This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to simulate a lively dance competition among turtles. Each turtle starts at a random position on the screen, sporting unique shapes and colors. They move based on nearby interactions, trying to stay within a defined radius of each other. It's a whimsical and colorful display of social dynamics, where turtles bust a move and groove their way across your monitor.
